      <p>I am a passionate Senior Computer Science and Engineering student at the American University of Beirut with a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My research interests include large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), active learning, and test-time fine-tuning. I am broadly interested in advancing AI capabilities and exploring their applications across diverse domains such as healthcare, education, and beyond. </p>

            we explored active learning for preference alignment and test-time fine-tuning.
            My work focused on the use of <em>herding models</em> and <em>Gaussian Process uncertainty</em> measurements to enhance large language models' ability to retrieve relevant documents for user queries and adapt their performance dynamically across tasks.

          Worked with 
          <a href="https://ammarmohanna.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Ammar Mohanna</a> 
          to develop an agentic RAG-based advising system that scrapes all university resources to answer any student question—from course instructors to office locations. The project won the <strong>Best Project Award</strong> in the <em>AI in Industry</em> course and is now being extended as our FYP, set to launch for 1,000+ students.

          <p>
            Conducted research on <em>Optimizing Deep Neural Networks via Safety-Guided Preservation Sets</em> 
            (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/placeholder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv preprint</a>), 
            under the supervision of <a href="https://ammarmohanna.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Ammar Mohanna</a>. 
            The project introduced a novel compression framework that enhances generalization and reduces variance through preservation-driven quantization. 
            This work was recognized among the <strong>Top 10 papers</strong> in the IEEE Student Paper Competition.

          Designed a multi-agent retrieval system where a master model routes queries to section-specific agents for targeted question answering. 
          Developed a progressive graph-building mechanism that incrementally expands document knowledge graphs with structured answers and source references, improving multi-hop reasoning and document comprehension.
